# dotfilesync

## Summary

I've needed an application that would sync my dotfiles. So, I wrote an
application that would sync my dotfiles.

Dotfilesync is a command-line application geared toward syncing your dotfiles
found in a configuration file using a git repository in the root of your home
directory. Point to the git repository, update your configuration file with the
dotfiles you would like to sync, and either configure automation that runs it on
a schedule or run it whenever you want.

Aim of this application is to be simple and straight forward to use without
overbearing and mindless configuration.

More coming soon.
